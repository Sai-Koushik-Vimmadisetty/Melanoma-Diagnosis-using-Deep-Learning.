This project was developed using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and compared three deep learning models for image classification using the SIIM-ISIC dataset. 
The models achieved accuracies of 77.65%, 77.28%, and 77.38%, respectively, and employed three crucial metrics to assess performance: accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. 
These metrics provide a detailed view of the models' performance and evaluate classification in different ways. 
The project utilized a range of deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and transfer learning, and the resulting models can be used for a variety of image classification tasks. 
The repository contains the code and documentation for the project, including the Jupyter notebooks used for model development and evaluation.
